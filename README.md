# credit-card-fraud-detection

According to an article by CNBC, the year 2019 witnessed a total of $28.65 billion worth of loss over payment card frauds across the globe. While we have much better and advanced modes of payment of money over the course of technological advancements, credit card frauds are still a prevelant problem today faced by millions of people on a regular basis. Hence, in this project we will try to spot a potential fraud so that customers cannot bill for products they haven't purchased. Our aim will be to create a classifier that indicates whether a requested transaction is a fraud.

Here are some of the Python libraries used in this project:

- Pandas: You can explore more about this library [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Seaborn: You can explore more about this library [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- Matplotlib: You can explore more about this library [here](https://matplotlib.org/)
- NumPy: You can explore more about this library [here](https://numpy.org/)
